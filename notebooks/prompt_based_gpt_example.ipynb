    "1. Log in to the openAI website\n",
    "2. Click on the \"Personal\" button in the top right corner and select \"View API Keys\"\n",

    "**Warning 1:** Keep your secret key private! The secret key is like your password, if others get access to your secret key then can use OpenAI with your payment details. I recommend storing your secret key in an environment variable or loading it from a file, don't store it in your code if you can avoid it!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning 2:** The OpenAI API is a paid service and every requests will use up your credits. Once you run out of free credits you will be charged for running predictions, these are generally very small amounts, but this can get out of hand if you don't pay attention, so code responsibly! You can set soft and hard limits in on the OpenAI website if you are worried about this."

For most tasks you are better off using one of the smaller models, such as Curie or Babbage. These models are easier to fine-tune, cheaper, and have a higher inference throughput.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Note #3:** There is a cost associated with fine-tuning a model through OpenAI. You will be provided with a cost estimate when running the `openai api fine_tunes.create` command. For a Curie or Babbage model the fine-tuning costs are generally managable (i.e., between $5 and $50 for most tasks). \n",
    "\n",
    "---- \n",
    "There is a fine-tuning queue, so you might have to wait a while for your fine-tuning to start. Once you fine-tune is complete you will be provided with a model id, which you can use to interact with the model through the API and the Playground. \n",

    "In this case my fine-tuned model is called `curie:ft-personal-2022-04-14-03-40-04`   \n",
